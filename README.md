### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a Computer Science student of UIC, I have learned many new languages, refined my problem solving skills, and got chances to apply my knowledge through projects both in and out of class.

I have completed multiple internships, in which I have gotten real-world experience, improved my teamwork and communication skills, and got a chance to make an impact in the world.

I want to use my experience to help make something meaningful in an internship this coming summer.

Key Skills: Python, C++, Java, Android App Development, Artificial Intelligence
