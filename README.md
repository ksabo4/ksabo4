### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I first came to love coding taking a Scratch class after school in 5th grade. It blew my mind that I could make games like Flappy Bird from nothing. As I became more experienced, I started to learn programming languages like Java and Python, using them to create my own projects. I found inspiration from YouTube creators such as Carykh or Michael Reeves. I knew that computer science was the right field for me.

As a Computer Science student at UIC, I have learned many new languages, refined my problem-solving skills, and got chances to apply my knowledge through projects both in and out of class.

I have completed multiple internships, in which I have gotten real-world experience, improved my teamwork and communication skills, and got a chance to make an impact in the world. In one internship, I created an Android app that could remotely communicate with a Smart Bandage that tracked the health of diabetic wounds. In another, I prototyped an app that could help underrepresented students find scholarships that fit their needs. In the internships, I drastically improved my Python, C++, C#, and Swift skills. 

I am very interested in Artificial Intelligence, taking a Machine Learning class this semester and studying algorithms on PyTorch and ScikitLearn.

I hope to learn more about AI and find an internship in a related field.

Key Skills: Python, C++, Java, Android App Development, Artificial Intelligence
